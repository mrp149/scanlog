Task

Design a simple solution to the situation described below using the Go
programming language and implemented as command-line program.  The input
will be a CSV file.  The output should be to stdout/stderr.

Description

Our marketing department would like some usage information regarding Remote
Builder service in Cloud.  We would like you to provide a very basic
reporting implementation for the data we have saved from the builds that
have been executed.  You will be given a CSV file that contains information
from our Remote Builder service that executes Singularity builds in our
Sylabs Cloud based on user requests.  The CSV file contents will consist of
fields in this order:

-Unique identifier for each build
-User ID reference the user that submitted the build request
-Time the build request was received (RFC 3339 formatted string)
-Time the build execution began (RFC 3339 formatted string)
-Time the build execution finished (RFC 3339 formatted string)
-Indicator for if the build has been deleted
-Exit code from the build process, >0 indicates failure
-Size of the resulting built image file

1.  The marketing department wants to know how many builds were executed in
a time window.  For example, how many builds were executed in the last 15
minutes, or in the last day, or between January 1 and January 31, 2018.

2.  The marketing department wants to know which users are using the remote
build service the most.  Who are the top 5 users and how many builds have
they executed in the time window?

3.  The marketing department would like to know the build success rate, and
for builds that are not succeeding what are the top exit codes.
